# ilabMonitor

## Overview



This program is for use by core facilities that use [Agilent's iLab Core Facility Management](https://www.agilent.com/en/products/lab-management-software/core-facility-management/ilab-core-facility-management) system.

The program monitors:
* Is the interlock control at Agilent reachable?
* Is the iLab web site running?
* Can a user log in to the iLab web site?
If any of these fail, the program will turn on your interlocks.
